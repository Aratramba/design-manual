`node examples/example` for now.

* [ ] docs: README update examples
* [ ] refactor queue
* [ ] if setup has changed, regenerate everything: store config in .json
* [ ] idea: supported browsers icons (browserstack integration?)
* [ ] navigation active state refactor?
* [ ] test: fix tests
* [ ] test: add gulp example
* [ ] test: add gulp test
* [ ] test: add electron tests
* [ ] test: add specific (non-output) tests
* [ ] js: fix js error in browser console
* [ ] split examples (at least break in code block, maybe even separate iframes?): idea: maybe pugdoc.output should be an array of code blocks instead of a single concatenated string.
